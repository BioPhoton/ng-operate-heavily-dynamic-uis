Use `ConterStateKeys` for property names.
Explort the counterUI API by typing `counterUI.` somewhere. ;)

3. If Set to button is clicked set counter value to input value while counting (+++)
4. Reset to initial state if reset button is clicked (+)
5. If count up button is clicked count up, if count down button is clicked count down  (+)
6. Change interval if input tickSpeed input changes (++)
7. Change count up if input countDiff changes (++)
